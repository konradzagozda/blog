    description: "Deep dive into advanced TypeScript patterns including mapped types, conditional types, and template literal types.",
    content: `TypeScript's type system is incredibly powerful, offering features that go well beyond simple type annotations. 
      In this article, we explore advanced patterns like mapped types for transforming existing types, conditional types for 
      type-level programming, and template literal types for string manipulation at the type level. We'll see how these 
      patterns can make our code more type-safe and maintainable.`,

      effectively use React.memo() for component memoization, useMemo() and useCallback() for expensive computations 
      and callbacks, and implement code splitting strategies. We'll also dive into bundle optimization techniques and 
      how to measure performance improvements.`,
